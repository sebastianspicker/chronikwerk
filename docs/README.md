# Documentation

Start with the [root README](../README.md) for installation, configuration, usage, development,
testing, operation, troubleshooting, and security basics. Come back here when you need the full
technical or operator reference.

How the pieces fit together: the README sets public scope and entry-level usage, this page is the
map, the ADRs record why accepted tradeoffs were made, the architecture/API/configuration
references define technical contracts, and the deployment, operations, and security documents are
operator runbooks. Where two pages overlap, trust the more specific contract or runbook — but it
does not widen the scope stated in the README.

## Architecture and data

- [Architecture](01-architecture.md): runtime flow, state transitions, module boundaries, and
  process constraints.
- [Data model](03-data-model.md): the ticket snapshot and audit-sidecar fields.
- [Path policy](04-path-policy.md): archive placement, validation, sanitization, and root
  confinement.
- [PDF rendering](05-pdf-rendering.md): the rendering pipeline, templates, sanitization, limits,
  and document structure.
- [Signing and timestamping](06-signing-and-timestamp.md): PAdES and RFC 3161 configuration,
  runtime behavior, and verification.
- [Storage](07-storage.md): output layout, atomic-write behavior, and filesystem requirements.

## Integration and operation

- [Zammad setup](02-zammad-setup.md): custom fields, tags, webhook authentication, and smoke tests.
- [Configuration reference](config-reference.md): precedence, environment keys, YAML structure,
  defaults, and validation.
- [API reference](api.md): endpoints, authentication, payloads, responses, and errors.
- [Deployment](deploy.md): Docker Compose and the optional systemd wrapper.
- [Operations](08-operations.md): health, metrics, updates, rollback, retries, and incident checks.
- [Security](09-security.md): trust boundaries, controls, hardening, and residual risks.
- [FAQ](faq.md): common runtime and deployment failures.

## Administration application

- [Administration application](admin-frontend.md): users, routes, state, configuration ownership,
  responsive behavior, and validation.
- [Screenshot tour](screenshots/README.md): the maintained renders and what they do and don't prove.

## Project and release references

- [Public-alpha candidate](alpha-release.md): what evaluators should expect, and the compatibility
  boundary.
- [Dependency locks](dependency-locks.md): hash-locked environments, image pins, regeneration, and
  the remaining operating-system package variability.
- [Release checklist](release-checklist.md): packaging, image, browser, PDF, security, and
  publication gates.
- [Migration to Chronikwerk](migration-to-chronikwerk.md): manual migration from the retired
  package layout.
