# 09 - Security

This document summarizes the service threat model and implemented mitigations.

```

## 2. Security-Relevant Assets

- webhook secret (`WEBHOOK_HMAC_SECRET` / legacy `WEBHOOK_SHARED_SECRET`)
- Zammad API token (`ZAMMAD_API_TOKEN`)
- signing material (`SIGNING_PFX_PATH`, `SIGNING_PFX_PASSWORD`)
- TSA credentials (`TSA_USER`, `TSA_PASS`)
- archive outputs (PDFs + sidecar checksums)

## 3. Threats and Mitigations

### Threat: forged webhook requests

Mitigations:
- HMAC verification (`X-Hub-Signature: sha1=<hex>` or `sha256=<hex>`) using `hmac.compare_digest`
- fail-closed default when no webhook secret is configured
- unsigned mode requires explicit opt-in

### Threat: replayed/duplicate webhook delivery

Mitigations:
- in-memory TTL dedupe keyed by `X-Zammad-Delivery`
- optional strict delivery ID requirement

Residual risk:
- dedupe state is process-local and reset on restart

### Threat: path traversal or arbitrary file write

Mitigations:
- strict segment validation and deterministic sanitization
- root confinement (`ensure_within_root`)
- symlink traversal rejection under storage root
- atomic replace writes

### Threat: secret leakage in logs or ticket notes

Mitigations:
- recursive event redaction for secret-like keys and secret objects
- free-text secret scrubbing in exception messages
- ticket error notes use scrubbed exception text

Redaction is best-effort (known keys and common patterns). Operators should avoid logging full config or raw exception traces in production; custom secret key names may need to be added to the redaction allowlist.

### Threat: request flood / oversized payload DoS

Mitigations:
- body size limit middleware (`MAX_BODY_BYTES`)
- token-bucket rate limiting (`RATE_LIMIT_*`)

### Threat: unsafe upstream transport settings

Mitigations:
- plaintext HTTP upstreams blocked by default
- TLS verification disable blocked by default
- loopback/link-local upstream hosts blocked by default
- explicit hardening overrides required for unsafe modes

### Threat: archive tampering on shared storage

Mitigations in application:
- deterministic paths
- controlled write flow
- SHA-256 sidecar checksum
- optional cryptographic PDF signing/timestamping

Operational controls required:
- least-privilege share credentials and ACLs
- snapshot/immutability policy at storage layer
- periodic integrity verification

## 4. Residual Risks

- no distributed durable dedupe store
- no built-in immutable/WORM enforcement
- **TOCTOU on symlink check:** the storage layer rejects paths that traverse symlinks under the root, but the check happens before the write. A symlink can be created between the check and the write (time-of-check to time-of-use race). For high-assurance deployments, use a dedicated mount or filesystem controls; the application cannot fully remove this risk.
- **O_NOFOLLOW (Bugs #14/#41):** Final file open uses `O_NOFOLLOW` where the platform provides it (`os.O_NOFOLLOW`). On platforms where `O_NOFOLLOW` is not defined (e.g. some Windows builds), it is passed as `0` and the kernel may follow a symlink at the target path. Symlink rejection under the storage root is still performed before write; this residual risk applies only to the last path component. Operators on such platforms should use a dedicated mount or avoid symlinks in the archive tree.
- **Delivery ID dedupe is in-memory only:** duplicate webhook deliveries can be processed again after a process restart; no durable idempotency store.
- **TEMPLATES_ROOT:** when set (env), the process loads HTML templates from that path. Only the process owner should set it; point it to a controlled directory.
- archive long-term trust depends on external trust and storage controls

## 5. Hardening Checklist

- restrict network access to `/ingest` to trusted sources
- configure and rotate webhook HMAC secret
- keep body/rate limits enabled and tuned
- require delivery IDs when available
- protect `/metrics` access when enabled (set `METRICS_BEARER_TOKEN` or restrict by network)
- when behind a reverse proxy, set `RATE_LIMIT_CLIENT_KEY_HEADER=X-Forwarded-For` so rate limits apply per client IP (trust proxy to set the header)
- secure and monitor storage mount permissions
- keep signing/TSA credentials in secrets management, not source-controlled files
