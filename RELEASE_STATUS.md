# Public alpha status

## Candidate

| Field | Current value |
| --- | --- |
| Version | `0.3.0a1` |
| Proposed tag | `v0.3.0-alpha.1` |
| Publication state | Unreleased |
| Readiness | Not ready for publication |
| Status reviewed | 2026-09-02 |

The worktree is an unfrozen development candidate with uncommitted product, demo, documentation,
and generated-asset changes. It is suitable only for local evaluation with non-production data.
A source checkout, package, image, screenshot, or Pages artifact counts as release evidence only
when it is produced from — and verified against — the same reviewed tag.

## What works today

The candidate can:

- accept authenticated Zammad webhooks and run bounded background work in-process;
- render a localized PDF together with its JSON audit sidecar;
- optionally apply a PAdES signature and an RFC 3161 timestamp;
- write under a confined archive root and project the outcome back to Zammad; and
- expose optional authenticated history and metrics plus a disabled-by-default administration
  application.

The runtime is single-process. Admission, jobs, history, sessions, replay deduplication, and ticket
locks are volatile, so `202 Accepted` confirms admission rather than archival completion. The static
Pages demo uses synthetic browser-local state and is not an operational deployment or release
validation surface.

## Repository checks

These aggregate gates are defined in the repository:

- `make verify-core`: Python and frontend checks, tests with coverage, documentation and source
  policy checks, package build, clean-wheel import, and repository smoke checks.
- `make verify`: `verify-core` plus the production-image smoke test.
- The security workflow: separate fail-closed dependency audits for the base and signing
  environments.
- `make pdf-ua-check PDF_FILES="..."`: pinned veraPDF validation for representative output.

No earlier result proves anything about the current dirty worktree. When the candidate is frozen,
record automated results, external evidence, artifact checksums, and the exact commit or tag
together.

## Open publication gates

Publication still requires all of the following against the exact proposed tag:

- a complete `make verify` run and security-workflow results;
- live Zammad workflow verification, including terminal tags and internal notes;
- production storage, signing, TSA, TLS-proxy, restart, and recovery checks;
- representative signed and unsigned PDF/UA validation;
- Chromium, Firefox, WebKit, narrow-layout, keyboard, and automated accessibility checks;
- manual screen-reader, reading-order, contrast, 400 percent zoom, and populated-data review; and
- review of packages, image, checksums, release notes, screenshots, and the static demo artifact.

## Known release risks

- Python release dependencies are range-based rather than hash-pinned.
- Docker base images and operating-system packages are not immutable.
- Container registry publication is not configured.
- Delivery-ID signing is opt-in, while process-local replay state resets on restart.
- Deep storage health and FastAPI documentation routes are unauthenticated and need a trusted
  network boundary.
- Private vulnerability reporting has not been verified, and no fallback private channel is
  published.
- The copyright holder, dependency-license inventory, image SBOM, and attribution review are not
  established in repository evidence.

## Maintained artifacts

The packaged admin files `src/chronikwerk/web/static/admin/admin.js` and `admin.css` are generated
from `frontend/` and intentionally versioned. The administration screenshots and their manifest are
maintained documentation assets. The Pages workflow builds its static artifact from `demo/site/`;
`build/` and `dist/` stay generated output.

Do not publish the candidate until the source is frozen, every required automated, manual, and
external gate passes against that state, and a release owner reviews the resulting artifacts.
