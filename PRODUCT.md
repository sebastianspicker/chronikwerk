# Product contract

## Users

Chronikwerk supports operations and DevOps administrators, Zammad administrators,
support leads, compliance reviewers, and security or release maintainers. They work
mainly on desktop and laptop systems during deployment, routine operations, or
incident response, and they need dense, keyboard-accessible access to truthful service
state without exposing secrets. Help-desk staff continue to work in Zammad.

## Product purpose

Chronikwerk turns authenticated Zammad webhook events into archival PDFs, audit
sidecars, and visible Zammad outcomes, with optional PAdES signatures and RFC 3161
timestamps. Its administration application exposes health, process-local history, safe
retries, and staged non-secret configuration. Success means operators can distinguish
admitted work from completed archiving, understand volatile and staged state, recover
safely, and produce complete German or English archive documents.

## Brand personality

Dependable, institutional, precise. Chronikwerk is calm and utilitarian. It earns trust
through direct operational language, explicit boundaries, and evidence rather than
decoration or unsupported compliance claims.

## Anti-references

Do not imitate decorative SaaS dashboards. Avoid
gradients, glass panels, glowing status indicators, hover-lift cards, fake metrics,
decorative charts, raw JSON as the primary presentation, transient toasts as the only
feedback, placeholder-only labels, parchment nostalgia, institutional seals that imply
certification, and ornamental motion. Do not duplicate archive browsing, durable queues,
secret management, live reload, or infrastructure restarts in the UI.

## Design principles

1. State operational truth, including volatility, staleness, and restart boundaries.
2. Keep expert data visible and scannable without exposing secrets.
3. Make consequential actions explicit, specific, and recoverable.
4. Prefer native semantics and familiar controls over custom interaction.
5. Use clear navigation, readable field labels, and the folio mark for orientation.
6. Preserve the primary Zammad workflow rather than duplicating it.

## Accessibility and inclusion

WCAG 2.2 AA is a release target for the administration application and PDF/UA-1 is a
release target for archive PDFs. German (`de-DE`) and English (`en-GB`) are supported.
Keyboard operation, visible focus, 400% zoom and reflow, reduced motion, non-color state
cues, correct language metadata, semantic structure, and human screen-reader checks are
release requirements rather than current conformance claims.
